# Customer Churn Analysis -Dashboard
Customer Churn Analysis 

Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify why customers leave, which segments are at risk, and how businesses can reduce churn.
Using SQL for data cleaning & analysis and Power BI for visualization, I built an interactive dashboard that provides actionable business insights to improve customer retention.

Business Objective
